# DearDiary

DearDiary is a simple command line diary written in Perl. I use it to keep a log of my achievements through the year. Given that I spend most days on the command line it's quick and easy to jot down what I've done - much quicker than opening up a dedicated record keeping application or visiting a website that does the same.

Why Perl? I started a job where I needed to write Perl so I created this as a simple application to try out the language. It also has the benefit that it's installed by default on Linux and OSX so DearDiary doesn't need any special dependences to be installed.

## Installation

2. Add the path.
3. Run the Setup.
